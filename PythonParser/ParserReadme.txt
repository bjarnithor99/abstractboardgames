The python parser attempts to implement a broader syntax, the main parser is located at 
ru_final_project\PythonParser\Parser\Parser.py
The Parser class there can be created
from python strings and with the .generateAST methood can generate an abstract syntax tree from the text.
The abstract syntax tree class in defined in 
ru_final_project\PythonParser\Parser\ASTType.py
This AST can then be used with the PythonGameEngine
ru_final_project\GameEngine\PythonGameEngine.py
