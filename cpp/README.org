* About
This is a C++ framework for the abstract board games language defined in
[[file:../language_description.txt][language_description.txt]]. The framework includes a parser (see [[file:./src/parsing/][parsing/]]) for
parsing game descriptions (see [[file:./games/][games/]] for examples), an interactive environment
(see [[file:./src/environment/][environment/]]) built game descriptions, and facilities to extend the
environment with user-defined concepts that are not supported by the language
itself (see [[file:./src/actions/][actions/]]).

This framework is meant to be compiled as Python bindings and used to create a
game playing agent.

* Requirements
- [[https://github.com/pybind/pybind11][pybind11]] to compile the Python bindings.
- (optional) [[https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen][Doxygen]] to compile the C++ framework's documentation.

* Compiling and running
Before compiling the C++ framework and the Python bindings you first have to run
#+begin_src bash
cmake -Dpybind11_ROOT=$(pybind11-config --cmakedir) .
#+end_src
If you have [[https://github.com/doxygen/doxygen][Doxygen]] installed you enable compilation of the framework's
documentation by running
#+begin_src bash
cmake -Dpybind11_ROOT=$(pybind11-config --cmakedir) -DBUILD_DOCS=IN .
#+end_src

To compile the C++ framework with the provided main file (meant for testing),
run
#+begin_src bash
make abstract-board-games
#+end_src
To compile the Python bindings for the C++ framework, run
#+begin_src bash
make python-bindings
#+end_src
To compile the documentation, run
#+begin_src bash
make docs
#+end_src

Note: running
#+begin_src bash
make
#+end_src
will compile both =abstract-board-games= and =python-bindings= but not =docs=.
