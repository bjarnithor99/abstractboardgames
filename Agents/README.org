Here are a few agents you can use with the game engines. All compatible agents
must inherit the [[file:./agent.py][agent.py]] base class.

The recommended agents are:
- [[file:./browser_gui_agent.py][The Browser GUI agent]] to play a game in your browser.
- [[file:./random_agent.py][The Random agent]] if you want to win easily.
- [[file:./mcts_agent.py][The MCTS agent]] if you want to train your own agent for a bigger challenge.
