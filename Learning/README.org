To train an agent, simply import the agent you want to train, and replace the
=MCTSAgent= in line 55 in [[file:./train.py][train.py]]. Due to the speed difference, you must use
the C++ game engine with the agents (train and play).

Due to Python imports, the training routine must be run as a Python module. To
run the training routine run the following from the project's parent directory
#+begin_src bash
python -m abstractboardgames.Learning.train
#+end_src
